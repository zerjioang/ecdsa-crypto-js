Web3 Crypto Library compatible with Ethereum **Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm** (ECDSA) `secp256k1` for Web Browsers.

## Features
* Key-Pair generation.
* Signing validation of messages.
* Offline signing of messages using `secp256k1`.

### Mention to ECDSA

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and ECDS`A` are a specific flavor of asymmetric cryptography. They are widely used in blockchain technology because of three reasons:

* Their computational performance is economical compared to a lot of other algorithms
* The keys that are generated are relatively short
* Bitcoin started it, so most new blockchain projects have copied it

`ECDSA` uses the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. Without getting into the mathematics of it, they require a set of constants to define this curve. The constants used by most blockchains are set in the `secp256k1` standard.
